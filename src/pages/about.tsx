                      It was supposed to be a simple job. Paint the exterior of our Auckland home. Three weeks, max.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                      I found a painter through a local Facebook group. Great reviews. Professional-looking website. He showed up on time for the quote, talked confidently about the work, and his price seemed fair. I paid a 50% deposit upfront — $3,800 — to cover materials and secure the booking.
                    </p>

                      <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-0">He showed up late. Made excuses. Left early. The paint he bought was cheap, streaky rubbish — not the premium exterior paint we'd agreed on.</p>

                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                      By the end of Week 2, half the house was painted poorly, the other half untouched. I called him. No answer. Texted him. Read receipts on, no reply.
                    </p>

                      I reported it to the police. They said it was a civil matter. I contacted Consumer Protection. They said I'd need to take him to the Disputes Tribunal — but good luck finding him. The Facebook group admin removed my warning post, saying "no negative reviews allowed."
