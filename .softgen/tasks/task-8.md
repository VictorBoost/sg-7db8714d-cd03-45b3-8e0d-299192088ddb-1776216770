## Notes
Enhance the existing Trust and Safety page at /muna/trust-and-safety with three comprehensive tabs. All data is already being logged; this task surfaces it for admin review and action.

Requirements:
- Tab 1: Bypass Attempts - view all content safety bypass attempts with quick actions
- Tab 2: Reports - view all user-submitted reports with resolution actions
- Tab 3: Banned Accounts - view all banned users with unban option
