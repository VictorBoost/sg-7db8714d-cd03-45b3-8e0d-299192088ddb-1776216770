## Notes

**GOAL:** Make platform secure and functional for launch in ONE DAY (8 hours)

**What we're building:**
1. Hide all contact info until payment complete (revenue protection)
2. In-app chat for contracts (communication channel)
3. Additional payment requests through platform (expand contract value)

**Tech stack:**
- Existing: `contract_messages` table (chat storage)
- Existing: `additional_charges` table (extra payments)
- Existing: AdditionalChargeRequest component (needs integration)
- New: ContractChat component
- Updates: Hide contact logic in 3 components

**Business logic:**
- Contact info (phone/email) hidden from everyone UNTIL payment complete
- Chat available ONLY on active contracts (status: in_progress, work_completed, evidence_uploaded)
- Additional charges can be requested through chat interface
- Client approves/declines additional charges
- If approved → Stripe payment → funds added to escrow

**Database - NO CHANGES NEEDED** (tables already exist):
- `contract_messages` - chat storage
- `additional_charges` - payment requests
- `contracts` - payment status tracking
