## Notes

Complete escrow system with 48-hour client approval window and **manual admin review** (safer than auto-release).

**Safety Philosophy:**
- **Option A (Automatic)**: Client approval → instant release
- **Option C (Safe)**: 48 hours of silence → flagged for manual admin review

This prevents automatic releases without client approval, providing maximum safety for clients.

**Key Features:**
- Payments held for 48 hours (or 10 seconds in test mode)
- Client can approve instantly via green card on Contracts page
- After 48 hours of silence, contract flagged for admin review
- Admin manually approves after reviewing work
- All release methods tracked (client_approval, admin_release)
- Bot clients auto-approve for seamless testing

**Owner Login Fix:**
- Fixed admin authentication (removed database dependency)
- Hardcoded owner emails for permanent access
- Added `/muna/change-password` feature
